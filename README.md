#Purpose 

Created with the idea that there was not a "Red Team" 80211 profile for Wireshark. \
This was a small passion project with a few ideas. Dont do 7000 colors you have to remember \
Show things important to doing a redteam event (like the RFCTF)

\
Things like:

 - IVs
 - Handshakes
 - Deauths
 - Certs
 - Creds


\
#Installation

 - Grab the release wifishark or Create zip file of the directory.
 - Install it in the same way you would any other profile in Wireshark

```
Right Click Profile: in the bottom right hand corner.
Import wifishark.zip file
```

#Usage
